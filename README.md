# Pop launcher plugins

A collection of plugins for the [Pop!\_OS launcher](https://github.com/pop-os/launcher).
I've created these for my own use, but if you find them useful, feel free to contribute or [report any issue](https://github.com/Jeusto/pop-launcher-plugins/issues/new).
The plugins are written in various languages because I wanted to try and compare languages I'm currently learning with languages that I'm already familiar with. So if all the plugins are not of the same quality, that's why.
